    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    The Malicious IP-Address Monitor project, developed as part of Project 1 (BTI3031) under the guidance of Dr. Simon Kramer at the BFH-TI, Bern University of Applied Sciences, aims to enhance internet security by detecting and reporting unauthorized system administration traffic. This section addresses the assessment criteria by clearly defining the initial situation, including the problems, opportunities, and constraints, and identifying all relevant stakeholders.

    \subsection{Initial Situation}\label{subsec:initial-situation}
    The current landscape of cybersecurity is increasingly complex and challenging. Our project addresses several critical issues:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Escalation of Cyber Threats:} The frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks are on the rise, posing significant risks to systems and data.
        \item \textbf{Unauthorized Access Incidents:} There has been a noticeable increase in incidents involving unauthorized access to systems, highlighting the need for more robust security measures.
        \item \textbf{Growing Number of Security Vulnerabilities:} As systems become more interconnected, the number of potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors increases.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Malicious Definition}\label{subsec:malicious-definition}

    To effectively monitor and mitigate threats, it is crucial to define what constitutes malicious activity:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Malicious IP Address:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An IP address that engages in harmful or unauthorized activities aimed at compromising system security.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Indicators:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Brute Force:} More than 5 login attempts within 10 seconds, indicating an attempt to guess passwords.
            \item \textbf{Traffic Spikes:} Sudden and unusual increases in network traffic, particularly on uncommon ports, which may suggest a scanning or exploitation attempt.
            \item \textbf{Failed Logins:} Multiple consecutive failed login attempts, suggesting attempts to gain unauthorized access.
            \item \textbf{Port Scanning:} Sequential access to multiple ports, indicative of an effort to identify open and vulnerable services.
            \item \textbf{Exploitation:} Activities targeting known vulnerabilities in SSH, SFTP, FTP, and other protocols.
            \item \textbf{Suspicious Transfers:} Large or unusual data transfers that may indicate data exfiltration or other malicious activity.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}


    \subsection{Goals of the Project}\label{subsec:goals-of-the-project}
    The project aims to achieve the following specific goals:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Setup Monitoring:} Deploy a Docker-based monitoring system across multiple servers to ensure comprehensive surveillance of network activities.
        \item \textbf{Define Malicious Criteria:} Develop and implement clear criteria for identifying malicious traffic, focusing on protocols such as SSH, SFTP, and IMAPS. These criteria will be implemented in Python scripts to automate detection.
        \item \textbf{Automate Responses:} Create automated mechanisms that respond to identified threats, reducing the time and effort required for manual intervention.
        \item \textbf{Develop Reporting Tools:} Build tools to generate actionable reports that provide system administrators with insights into detected threats and recommended actions.
        \item \textbf{Documentation:} Maintain thorough and up-to-date documentation to support the deployment, use, and maintenance of the monitoring system, ensuring that all team members and future users can easily understand and utilize the system.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Goals of the Product}\label{subsec:goals-of-the-product}
    The product itself is designed to meet the following goals:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Monitor:} Continuously track IP addresses and network activities to detect any signs of malicious behavior in real-time.
        \item \textbf{Identify:} Accurately detect and classify IP addresses as malicious based on predefined criteria and indicators.
        \item \textbf{Automate:} Provide automated responses to threats, such as blocking IP addresses or alerting administrators, to mitigate risks quickly and efficiently.
        \item \textbf{Report:} Generate comprehensive and actionable reports for system administrators within 24 hours of detecting malicious activities, enabling prompt and informed decision-making.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Scrum Framework Application}\label{sec:scrum-framework-application}
    The Scrum framework was essential in managing the project's complex software development processes, emphasizing teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress.

        \item \textbf{Scrum Master:} Pelletier Max - Facilitates Scrum practices and ensures team adherence.
        \item \textbf{Development Team:} Pernjak Stefani, Pelletier Max, Rezzonico Marco - Delivers potentially releasable increments each sprint.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Potential Stakeholders}\label{subsec:potential-stakeholders}
    While there are no official stakeholders, the project could be beneficial for the following groups:

    \begin{itemize}

    \subsection{Product Increment}\label{subsec:product-increment}
    The concept of the Product Increment is central to the Scrum framework, referring to the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a sprint, along with all previous sprints. For the Malicious IP-Address Monitor project, each increment is a step towards a fully functional monitoring system capable of detecting and reporting unauthorized system administration activities.

    During each sprint, the team focused on delivering specific features and functionalities that contribute to the overall effectiveness and usability of the system. These increments include, but are not limited to:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Basic monitoring functionality for IP addresses.
        \item Integration with AbuseIPDB for enhanced threat reporting.
        \item Real-time alerting mechanisms.
        \item User-friendly interface for viewing logs and alerts.
        \item Comprehensive documentation for setup and usage.
    \end{itemize}

    Each increment was thoroughly tested and reviewed to ensure it met the predefined Definition of Done, which includes criteria such as functionality, code quality, and integration capabilities. These increments collectively contribute to the development of a robust system designed to enhance internet security by providing real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities.
